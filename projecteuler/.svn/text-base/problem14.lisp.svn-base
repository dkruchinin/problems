;; problem â„–14
;; 
;; The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
;; n -> n/2 (n is even)
;; n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)
;; Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
;; 13  40  20  10  5  16  8  4  2  1
;; It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) 
;; contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), 
;; it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
;; Q: Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
