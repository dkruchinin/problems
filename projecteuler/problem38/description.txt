Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
